In Future for different api this number of middleware gets differ

Top To Bottom Approach:

2) From API Level:

    Request(Header, Body, token) - Response(Body, status)

3) Main Class For Streaming video - VideoManager (In The Video Manager - API Validation Has to take place)
4) First validation Check -> Authentication Check -> Authorisaton check
5) Authentication need to aware of token manager
6) Authorisation need to aware of user manager
